### Hi, I'm â„›haz!

ðŸŽ“ I'm an incoming **3rd year Information Systems student** at **Cebu Technological University-Main Campus**, part of the **CCICT Department**.<br>
ðŸ’¡ I use this Github to compile my projects and track my learning in web development and other programming projects.<br>
ðŸ“– Most of my repositories include front-end websites, coding practices, and soon might be from notes from courses or certifications I'm working on.<br>
ðŸ’» I'm currently focused on improving my skills in HTML, CSS JavaScript, and getting familiar with Git and GitHub.<br><br>

Feel free to check out my work as I continue to grow and learn in tech!
